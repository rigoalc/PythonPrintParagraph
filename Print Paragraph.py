Hello world, my name is Rodrigo Alcover 40 years old, and born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I'm a KVCC student for the last three years, seeking a software development degree. 

I have taken Programming logic, Java, and SQL classes. These little experiences make me feel or tend to front-end development, 
so after a meeting with a counselor, I have decided to study Python as a programming Language requirement for my major.

I would like to further my understandings of the concepts that I have learned during these past 2 years and use it to start my career.

# The development time was about 3 hours total because I needed to install homebrew and python extensions for the first time.

# This program prompt my introduction and a brief idea of why im taking Python class.
